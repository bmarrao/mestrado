compile and run the code as follows:

$ make -f makefile all
$ ./mutator threshold type_gc -- Without Generation Garbage Collector
$ ./mutator threshold size_of_eden n_survived type_gc_eden type_gc_tenured

Where type_gc : 
1 - Mark Sweep 
2 - Mark Compact 
3 - Copy Collection

to clean and leave just the source code

$ make -f makefile clean
