# Earley Algorithm
The **Earley algorithm** is a parsing algorithm designed to efficiently parse any context-free grammar (CFG), including ambiguous or left-recursive grammars. It operates in **O(n^3)** time in the worst case but can achieve **O(n)** time for certain grammars.
- **Working Mechanism**: The algorithm maintains a set of "states" that represent possible positions in the parsing process, tracking both input consumed and grammar rules applied. It builds a parse table while processing the input string.
- **Applications**: The algorithm is particularly useful for complex grammars, making it a valuable tool for language processing tasks.
