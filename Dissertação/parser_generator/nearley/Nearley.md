# Nearley 
- Nearley uses the **Earley** algorithm (Algorithm that uses dynamic programming , storing ) . It also implements Joop Leo’s optimizations for right-recursion, making it effectively **linear-time** for LL(k) grammars.
- Nearley outputs **small** files. And its **expressive** DSL comes with plenty of **syntactic sugar** to keep files short.
- Nearley’s grammar language is powerful and expressive: you can use **macros**, import from a large **builtin library** of pre-defined parser-pieces, use a **tokenizer** for extra performance, and more!
