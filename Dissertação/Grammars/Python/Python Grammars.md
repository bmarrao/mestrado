# Python Grammars 
- **python.gram** from https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html - Python grammar from its own website . The notation is a mixture of [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) and [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar). In particular, `&` followed by a symbol, token or parenthesized group indicates a positive lookahead (i.e., is required to match but not consumed), while `!` indicates a negative lookahead (i.e., is required **not** to match). We use the `|` separator to mean PEG’s “ordered choice” (written as `/` in traditional PEG grammars).
- **https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/python/python3**  Contains grammar for python3 , supports most of Python 3's syntax, making it suitable for building tools like linters, analyzers, or transpilers.
