XML CAN BE TEXT OR DATA ORIENTED. WHEN A DOCUMENT IS TEXT-ORIENTED ITS FORMATING :
. uses elements with mixed content
- has a very regular strucutre
- is analogous to a data structure

ONE OF THE PROBLEMS DETECTED IN HTML AND THAT XML ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE WAS 
-THE RELAXATION OF WELL-FORMEDNESS RULES
-THE LACK OF ANNOTATIONS FOR GRAPHIC FORMATTING
-THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF FEATURES
